## History and Contributors

`soundworks` has been initiated by [Norbert Schnell](https://github.com/NorbertSchnell), [Sébastien Robaszkiewicz](https://github.com/i-Robi), and [Benjamin Matuszewski](https://github.com/b-ma) at the [ISMM](http://ismm.ircam.fr/) team at [Ircam - Centre Pompidou](http://www.ircam.fr/) in the framework of the [*CoSiMa*](http://cosima.ircam.fr/) research project supported by the [French National Research Agency (ANR)](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/en/).

Further development of the framework has been conducted in the context of:

- The [RAPID-MIX project](http://rapidmix.goldsmithsdigital.com/), funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme.
- The Ircam UPI projects _BeCoMe_ and _SO(a)P_
- The _Constella(c)tions_ residency of the STARTS program of the European Commission.

Development is being pursued, led by [Benjamin Matuszewski](https://github.com/b-ma), in the [Interaction Music Mouvement Team](https://www.stms-lab.fr/team/interaction-son-musique-mouvement/) from the Ircam's [STMS-LAB](https://www.stms-lab.fr/).
